At that time, I participated in the competition for the first time, and I was very happy to win the award, but I knew I had to be modest.</p>

I often made posters for the class, and also served as the assistant of video arts, from which I also learned a lot of experience. There are also many group activities and reports for other subjects. Groups can practice group cooperation and leadership skills, and reports can also develop better presentation skills.</p>

                    <p class="col__content-txt">In my first year of high school, I took the position of secretary of the school's TV station, which allowed me to learn more about the importance of teamwork. I will also help with the design of the post, which is the one I am most interested in, so that I have more opportunities to practice design. In that year, our senior grade held a charity activity. My classmates and I were in charge of hand-making. When I saw that my classmates bought my hand-making and they would use it, I felt a great sense of accomplishment and pleasure.In the second year of high school, I won a painting contest held by the student Union. The school sold my works into postcards to the public and donated the money to charity. I think art can not only bring me a sense of accomplishment, but also help people.I also attended the sewing class of Macao Productivity Center and learned a lot of sewing skills and made myself more patient. In addition, I also went to Hong Kong Writing Workshop from USA Education  for exchange, which helped me learn more writing and grammar skills.</p>

My dream is to work in art. When I become a designer in the future, I want to add more original designs for Macau, because I find that most of them buy products from other places, and there are very few original designs. However, I have also observed that in recent years, there is more room for the development of original design, and original design is gradually increasing.
So I want to be a good designer.
in addition ,this is my favorite work ,What this painting wants to express is that although the goal is far away, we still have to strive towards it. No matter how hard it is.
